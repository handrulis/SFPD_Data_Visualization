# SFPD_Data_Visualization
For this challenge I created a web page that visualizes the data set given using the Google charts and maps APIs. The first section of the page contains three charts that graph metrics from the data set. Following the charts is the section of the page responsible for predicting the most likely dispatch type needed given the zip code and time at which the incident occurred. The third section contain a scatter plot graph displaying dispatch times for each zip code and my response as to how these times can be improved. The page ends with a heat map displaying all the locations of all the incidents from the data set. At the top of the page is a navigation bar to allow one to conveniently go to the desired section of the page. Also available in the navigation bar is an option that allows the user to upload different data sets of the same format as the one given so that that data can be displayed in the charts on the page. In order to create this page, I used JavaScript to parse and sort through the given CSV file and add interactivity to the web page. I then used HTML and CSS to give the page structure and style.
